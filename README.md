# Sawzall ðŸªš

Sawzall wraps the Rust scraper library (https://github.com/rust-scraper/scraper) to make it easy to parse HTML documents and query them with CSS selectors.

```ruby
require "sawzall"
require "net/http"

doc = Sawzall.parse_document(Net::HTTP.get("example.org", "/"))
doc.select("title").first.text #=> "Example Domain"
```

> [!NOTE]
> Sawzall is a hobby project. Expect ongoing development and maintenance to be very much correlated to how much value it brings me as a learning resource and as a tool for my other projects.
